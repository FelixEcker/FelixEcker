Hi, im Felix / Bertrahm, im a self taught Java & Python programmer and in an apprentice ship as a Programmer. I primarly use GNU/Linux. I like to work on small side projects like a Program to find [Strings in a large binary file](https://www.github.com/FelixEcker/DataRescue), which I used to recover passwords from a broken partition. I also attempt to make games from time to time.
